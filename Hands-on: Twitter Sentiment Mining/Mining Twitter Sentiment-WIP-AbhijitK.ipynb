    "#### Is it TRUE or FALSE?\n",
    "This type of conditional assessment is often used in programming. The logical operators evaluate boolean conditions of a query expression. The logical operators like OR, AND, NOT join two or more clauses of a query expressions and return a single logical value of either TRUE or FALSE. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is no different in MongoDB query. A MongoDB query targets a specific collection of documents. Queries specify criteria, or conditions, that identify the documents MongoDB returns to the clients. MongoDB query specifies the criteria and conditions using the following logical operators within the [db.collection.find()](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/#db.collection.find) method to receive the matching documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `$OR`: Returns all documents that match either conditions of the conditional clauses\n",
    "2. `$AND`: Returns all documents that match all conditions of clauses\n",
    "3. `$NOT`: Returns documents that do not match the query condition\n",
    "4. `$NOR`: Returns all documents that fail to match either conditional clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The OR operator \n",
    "Using the `$OR` operator, you can specify a query that joins each clause with a logical OR so that the query selects the documents in the collection that match at least one condition. In syntaxical language, the `$OR` operator performs a logical OR operation on two or more `<expressions>` and selects the documents that satisfy at least one of the `<expressions>`. This is expressed as the following query syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{ $or: [ { <expression1> }, { <expression2> },..., { <expressionN> } ] }`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below example, the query will select all documents in the inventory collection where either the quantity field value is less than (`$lt`) 20 or the price field value equals 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "`db.inventory.find( { $or: [ { quantity: { $lt: 20 } }, { price: 10 } ] } )`\n",
    "\n",
    "With additional clauses, you can specify precise conditions. In the below example, the compound query selects all documents in the collection where the value of the *type* field is *'food'* and *either* the *qty* has a value greater than (`$gt`) 100 or the value of the *price* field is less than (`$lt`) 9.95:\n",
    "\n",
    "`db.inventory.find(\n",
    "   {\n",
    "     type: 'food',\n",
    "     $or: [ { qty: { $gt: 100 } }, { price: { $lt: 9.95 } } ]\n",
    "   }\n",
    ")`\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating the clauses in the `$or` expression, MongoDB either performs a collection scan or, if all the clauses are supported by indexes, MongoDB performs index scans. The index scan is required when `$or` is used with `$text` and sort() operations. This change was introduced in the 2.6 version of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, the `$OR` operator helps user to receive the output satisfying at least one of many conditional clauses in the MongoDB query expression."
